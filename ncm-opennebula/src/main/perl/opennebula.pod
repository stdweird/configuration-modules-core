- Example pan files are included in the examples folder and also in the test folders.


To set up the initial cluster, some steps should be taken:

=over 

=item 1. First install the required gems as root in your OpenNebula server: /usr/share/one/install_gems

=item 2. The OpenNebula server(s) should have passwordless ssh access as oneadmin user to all the hypervisor hosts of the cluster e.g. by distributing the public key(s) of the OpenNebula host over the cluster

=item 3. Start OpenNebula services: # for i in '' -econe -gate -novnc -occi -sunstone; do service opennebula$i stop; done

=item 4. Run the component a first time

=item 5. The new oneadmin password will be available from /var/lib/one/.one/one_auth.new file
